# Charts with ```matplotlib```

[./charts.py](./charts.py) contains functions to draw charts. You need to pass arguments as labels and data.

* [./word_count.py](./word_count.py) contains code that displays a chart of most used words in Leo Tolstoi's "War and Peace" 
* [./word_count.built-in.py](./word_count.built-in.py) the same logic, but this time we use Python's built-in ```Counter``` class from ```collections``` package
